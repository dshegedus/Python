### Personal Savings Calculator. Since I have my bike, I can save upto £11/day on transport. 
### Additionally, £5/day per meal at work if I bring my lunch.
### These savings will exclude days when I can claim expenses.

### The whole point of this basic python code is to see how much I can save and if I intend to buy something how many "extra" days I need to cycle to save up for it.
